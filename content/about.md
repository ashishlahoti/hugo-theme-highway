Hey Everyone! Iâ€™m Ashish Lahoti. Welcome to the blog site created using Hugo static site generator.

When I started using Hugo to build my website, I doesn't have much knowledge about so I chose the Hugo Mainroad Theme to build my blog website.

Over the period of time, as my blog website started growing. I wanted to have many features which were not available in Mainroad theme so I started implementing them on my own.

It's time to payback to the community that is why I am sharing Mainroad theme + Features which I have implemented so far:

1. Client Side Search Engine to search content from your entire blog site
2. Autonumbering feature to autonumber sections and subsections of your blog post
3. Nested menu and submenu can be configured from config.toml file
4. Multiple Author support
5. Generator JSON+LD application json for your blog posts for Search Engine Optimization
6. Social Icons on each page to share your post on social media
